Overview

Ive been playing fantasy football for years now and have yet to find a draft helper that I liked.I found bits and pieces that I found useful but never a full application ,so I made one.
I created a Fanasty Football helper using python and tk inter that helps you in your fanasty football drafts.The rankings.csv file was gathered from fantasypros.com and would need to be updated for 
each year you wish to use it for .The helper is able to keep track of your team along with the other teams in the draft and give you recommendations based on who you already drafted.

How to Run

The gui can be loaded by running the fantasy_fb_gui.py file in your local enviroment after installing tkinter

Future upgrades

For future implementations of this program I would like to use a machine learning algorithm in order to appropriately determine which player is best for your team based off many differ traits 
such as injury history , team success, opportunity and more.I would also like to update the GUI to a more modern and pleasing display.Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
