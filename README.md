**Overview**
____________

After years of playing fantasy football, I have yet to find a draft helper that I was satisfied with. While I have found individual components that were useful, I have never been able to locate a comprehensive application. Therefore, I decided to create one.

I developed a Fantasy Football helper using Python and Streamlit that assists you in your fantasy football drafts. The rankings.csv file was obtained from fantasypros.com and requires periodic updates for each year you intend to use it. The helper maintains records of your team and other teams in the draft, providing recommendations based on various factors.

**How to Run**
_______________

To execute the helper, install the necessary packages and run the following command in the terminal: streamlit run streamlit.py

**Future Upgrades**

For future enhancements of this program, I intend to incorporate a machine learning algorithm to determine the most suitable player for your team based on a multitude of attributes, including injury history, team success, and opportunities. Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated.
