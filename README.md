# Fantasy Football Draft Helper: Making Drafting Easier

## Project Overview
After years of playing fantasy football, I have yet to find a draft helper that I was satisfied with. While I have found individual components that were useful, I have never been able to locate a comprehensive application. Therefore, I decided to create one.

I developed a Fantasy Football helper using Python and Streamlit that assists you in your fantasy football drafts. The rankings.csv file was obtained from fantasypros.com and requires periodic updates for each year you intend to use it. The helper maintains records of your team and other teams in the draft, providing recommendations based on various factors.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: 
  - Streamlit: For building an interactive user interface

## Dataset
The project utilized multiple datasets from the US Labor Statistics website, including:
- **Education, Occupation, Industry, and Labor Force Data**: Projections from 2019-2029 and 2023-2033.
- **Manually Created User and Job Datasets**: Tailored to simulate real-world job seeker scenarios.

## Application Flow
### Home Page
- Displays the draft board as well as a list of best available players
- Allows users to change what position they are targeting
- Buttons on the bottom of the page that will direct you to other features

### Other Pages
- **Stat Search Dashboard**: Provides broad insights into a player of your choice.
- **Team Info Dashboard**: Offers detailed breakdown of each team currently drafted.
- **Favorites Dashboard**: Allows you to favorite players in the draft that are saved to your user account.


## Future Scope
- **Machine Learning Recommnedation System**: For future enhancements of this program, I intend to incorporate a machine learning algorithm to determine the most suitable player for your team based on a multitude of attributes, including injury history, team success, and opportunities. Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated.
